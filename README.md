Todo entity is defined as: ID, description
Example of description: "Sleep, go to play football"

## Comments about test

1. Test are in project TodoTestUnit
2. I use mocks for testing
3. Testing are for GET /api/todos

## Important

1. TodosController have a dependency injection of a repository that manage the list of todo
2. TodosController have a dependency injection of a featureflag to manage feature flags
3. Solid principles 
4. ItÂ´s used the Repository pattern
5. I also added an Authcontroller for login with JWT and random users,  but for this instance y mark the controller TodoList as a [AllowAnonymous] for easiest check.
